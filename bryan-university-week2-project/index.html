        <!--block-->> Many published books use a device to separate certain
        paragraphs further when there is a change of scene or time. This extra
        space, especially when co-occurring at a page or section break, may
        contain an asterisk, three asterisks, a special stylistic dingbat, or a
        special symbol known as an asterism.
